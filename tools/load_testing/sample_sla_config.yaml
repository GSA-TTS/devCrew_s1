# Issue #37: Sample SLA Configuration
# Define performance thresholds for load test validation

# SLA Definitions
slas:
  # Response Time SLAs
  - name: "P95 Response Time SLA"
    metric: "p95_response_time"
    threshold: 500  # milliseconds
    operator: "less_than"

  - name: "P99 Response Time SLA"
    metric: "p99_response_time"
    threshold: 1000  # milliseconds
    operator: "less_than"

  - name: "Average Response Time SLA"
    metric: "avg_response_time"
    threshold: 300  # milliseconds
    operator: "less_than"

  # Error Rate SLAs
  - name: "Error Rate SLA (99.9% Success)"
    metric: "error_rate"
    threshold: 0.1  # 0.1% error rate = 99.9% success rate
    operator: "less_than"

  # Throughput SLAs
  - name: "Minimum Throughput"
    metric: "requests_per_second"
    threshold: 10  # RPS
    operator: "greater_than_or_equal"

# Bottleneck Detection Thresholds
latency_threshold_ms: 500  # P95 latency threshold in milliseconds
error_rate_threshold: 1.0  # Maximum acceptable error rate percentage

# Capacity Planning Targets
target_latency_ms: 400  # Target P95 latency for capacity recommendations
target_error_rate: 0.5  # Target error rate percentage for capacity recommendations
